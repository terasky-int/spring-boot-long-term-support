# Spring Boot Legacy Security Demo  

## Overview  
This repository is a **demo showcasing an older version of Spring Boot** that is **no longer publicly maintained for security patches** by the Spring team.  

While regular Spring users can upgrade to the latest version to receive ongoing security updates, **organizations relying on older versions** must either:  
- Upgrade to a **supported** Spring version, or  
- **Obtain commercial support** for backported security fixes.  

This demo highlights the **risks of running outdated Spring versions** and demonstrates how to assess your application's dependency health.  

## Spring Health Assessment  

Our **Spring Health Assessment** report helps you understand the **health of your Spring dependencies**. The generated report will provide:  
‚úÖ **Security vulnerability analysis**  
‚úÖ **Upgrade effort estimation**  
‚úÖ **Library support duration**  

By using this assessment, you can:  
- **Remediate issues** based on recommendations  
- **Improve software compliance**  
- **Mitigate risks** associated with outdated dependencies
